STEPS TO COMPILE AND CREATE PATCH:

All of these assume you're in the correct directory where either the ROM is or asar is. 

1) Copy rom file via command line (copy and paste works too):

copy ffv.sfc ffv_hacks.sfc /y



2) Apply asm patches. In this example, all_patches. Make sure settings such as vanillarewards are set correctly. Multiple patches here are fine, but make sure to do all_patches.asm first. 

"asar.exe" --fix-checksum=off "FFVCareerDay\project_demi\asm\asm_patches\all_patches.asm" "ffv_hacks.sfc



3) Use Lunar IPS to 'Create Patch', first select 'ffv.sfc', then select 'ffv_hacks.sfc'. 

If you want 1 patch that handles everything for all_patches and randomizer, then simply patch everything via step 2 then create one IPS file.



If you want to patch a main.ips base (all_patches), then make a randomizer file: 
- Step 1
- Step 2, only all_patches
- Step 3, generating main.ips
- Step 1
- Step 2, only randomizer patch
- Step 3, generating random.ips
- Step 1

Then both IPS files can be applied independently. DO REALIZE that the randomizer file needs main.ips to be along with it in order for randomization to work.  If !vanillarewards == 0 in main_patches, then it's expecting to assign jobs at the beginning of the game (address $E79F00), and will cause glitched jobs if randomizer patch isn't applied.
