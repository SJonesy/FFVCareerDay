# FFV: Project Demi

Included in this release is a program called Lunar IPS that can apply these patches to your own rom of FF5.
Make sure you patch these onto an FF5 rom that is already patched with the RPGe Translation Patch.
That patch is located here (https://www.romhacking.net/translations/353/), and Lunar IPS can be used to patch that onto a FF5 Japanese Rom.

***Please patch 'main.ips' first, then patch any other patches. ***
